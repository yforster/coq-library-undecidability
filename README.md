[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability.svg?branch=coq-8.12)](https://travis-ci.org/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability)

This library contains undecidable problems and formalised reductions between them.

## How to build

If you can use `opam 2` on your system, you can follow the instructions here.
If you cannot use `opam 2`, you can use the `noopam` branch of this repository, which has no dependencies, but less available problems.

### Install from opam

We recommend creating a fresh opam switch:

```
opam switch create coq-library-undecidability 4.09.1+flambda
eval $(opam env)
```

Then the following commands install the library:

```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam repo add psl-opam-repository https://github.com/uds-psl/psl-opam-repository.git
opam install coq-library-undecidability.dev+8.12
```

### Manual installation

You need `Coq 8.12` built on OCAML `>= 4.07.1`, the [Smpl](https://github.com/uds-psl/smpl) package, the [PSL Base](https://github.com/uds-psl/base-library) library, the [Equations](https://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/) package, and the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/metacoq/) package for Coq. If you are using opam 2 you can use the following commands to install the dependencies on a new switch:

```
opam switch create coq-library-undecidability 4.07.1+flambda
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam repo add psl-opam-repository https://github.com/uds-psl/psl-opam-repository.git
opam install . --deps-only
```

### Building the undecidability library

- `make all` builds the library
- `make html` generates clickable coqdoc `.html` in the `website` subdirectory
- `make clean` removes all build files in `theories` and `.html` files in the `website` directory
- `make realclean` also removes all build files in the `external` directory. You have to run `make deps` again after this.

### Troubleshooting

#### Windows

If you use Visual Studio Code on Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), then local opam switches may cause issues.
To avoid this, you can use a non-local opam switch, i.e. `opam switch create 4.07.1+flambda`.

#### Coq version

Be careful that this branch only compiles under Coq 8.12. If you want to use a different Coq version you have to change to a different branch.
Due to compatibility issues, not every branch contains exactly the same problems. 
We recommend to use the newest branch if possible.
